This package provides an abstraction for dealing with the runtime system's Cubase installation(s).

`Cubase` is the base abstraction, and contains everything else.

`CubaseApp` is an abstraction for a *single* Cubase installation, e.g. one CubaseApp for Cubase 12, another CubaseApp for Cubase 13, etc.
